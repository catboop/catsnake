## CatSnake

This is my own version of the classic Snake game. This was made using Python's Pygame module. 

### For Users
1) Clone repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/catboop/snakeygame.git
```

2) Run `custom.py` file
```
cd snakeygame
python custom.py
```

3) Use the arrow keys to move the snake around. Try to eat all the goodies that pop up, while avoiding the walls or your tail. 

### Version Used
Python 3.8.5
